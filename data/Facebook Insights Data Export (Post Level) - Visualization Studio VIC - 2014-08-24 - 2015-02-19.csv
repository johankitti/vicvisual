While the exascale machines will enable scientific simulations that are beyond the current capability, there are also challenges to be addressed in order to effectively exploit this power. The magnetosphere is the region filled with plasma around a magnetic astronomical objects like the Earth, the Moon, and Jupiter. Earth's magnetosphere shields the planet from the incoming charged particles in the Solar Wind, which is vital for life to develop and to sustain. Realistic simulations of the dynamics between Solar Wind and Magnetosphere remain challenging even on exascale machines.

In this talk, a massively parallel Particle-in-Cell code, iPic3D, will be introduced. Results using iPic3D for a global simulation of the formation of a magnetosphere are to be present. The challenges in moving towards exascale simulations: extreme parallelism, run-time error and I/O bottleneck, are to be discussed. Our approaches, preparation works and strategies that are done in the EPiGRAM project (http://www.epigram-project.eu/) to address these challenges will also be present: simulation of performance at large scale, the hybrid programming model using PGAS and Message Passing, offloading intensive computation to GPU, different I/O strategies and sparse collectives.",Photo,,,"01/28/2015 07:29:46 AM"," ",256,256,0,740,740,0,37,,4,,1,,5,,1,37,154,,28,21,,,43,111,,0,0,,,,,610,180,0,0,34,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baden from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California, San Diego gave a presentation on how scientist from different areas can translate their work to utilize the HPC domain. Title: &quot;Engineering for High Performance through Domain Specific Translations&quot;

Abstract:
Building a high performance application is a time consuming task: the programmer must manage locality and parallelism at  multiple levels, entailing considerable code restructuring.  Most users would rather remain aloof of the details.

I will describe research  in domain specific translation that significantly reduces the programmer's burden: restructuring MPI applications to tolerate communication delays automatically, generating MPI code (and CUDA) for stencil methods.

I will show that Domain specific translation enables the domain scientist to remain focused on the domain science, while realizing performance usually attributed to expert coders on a range of platforms. I will close by sketching some details of ongoing research in run time techniques that may one day be incorporated into future translators.",Photo,,,"11/28/2014 04:51:15 AM"," ",58,58,0,134,134,0,14,,3,,,,3,,,12,55,,5,9,,,14,41,,0,0,,,,,96,24,0,0,4,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
