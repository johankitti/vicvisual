SIGRAD, the Swedish Chapter of Eurographics, invites submissions to its 36th annual conference, which will be held in the Vizualisation Studio (VIC) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm on the 1st and 2nd of June 2015.
 
SIGRAD is the premier Nordic forum for computer graphics and visualization advances for academia and industry. It brings together researchers and practitioners with interest in techniques, tools, and technology from various fields, such as visualization, computer graphics, visual analytics and human-computer interaction.
 
In addition to the regular submissions concerning general computer graphics practices, this year's conference will also investigate and foster potential synergies between industry, pedagogical practitioners and academic researchers through a special focus on themes related to visualization, interactive computer graphics and games technologies and their use in educational practices.
 
Interactive computer graphics and animation techniques are the basis for the sophisticated modern technologies that drive computer games and the associated multi-billion dollar industry. Further, visualization, computer graphics techniques and games have great potential in educational tools and methodologies, representing a motivational force for better engaging students in pedagogical activities concerning science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.
 
As a special focus at SIGRAD 2015, we welcome papers related to the following topics from academia and industry:
 
1) Position papers and/or posters presenting state-of-the-art graphics and animation technologies in the Swedish computer games industry.
 
2) Academic research concerning novel techniques and potentially significant advances in visualization, interactive computer graphics and computer game technologies.
 
3) Descriptions of novel courses/curricula, approaches and teaching experiences involving the use of computer graphics visualizations and games techniques in Swedish academia for better communicating concepts or motivating students to engage in learning activities.
 
Note that submissions outside of the scope of the special focus will receive equal consideration for acceptance during the review process.
 
A core objective of the conference is to engage students, at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, in visualization and computer graphics research. Special provision has therefore been made for students to attend and present at the conference at heavily discounted rates (see STUDENT REGISTRATION below for conditions).",Photo,,,"05/27/2015 03:33:17 AM"," ",1,1,0,1,1,0,22,,4,,,,5,,,19,35,,,19,,,,35,,0,0,,,0,0,0,0,13,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
